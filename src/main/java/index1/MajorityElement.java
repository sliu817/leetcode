 * Runtime: O(n) â€” Moore voting algorithm: We maintain a current candidate and a counter initialized to 0.
 * As we iterate the array, we look at the current element x:
 *      If the counter is 0, we set the current candidate to x and the counter to 1.
 *      If the counter is not 0, we increment or decrement the counter based on whether x is the current candidate.
 * After one pass, the current candidate is the majority element. Runtime complexity = O(n).
